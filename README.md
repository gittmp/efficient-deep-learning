# Addressing the Energy Efficiency of Deep Learning Algorithms in Finance

This thesis investigates the efficiency of deep learning training algorithms, exploring how deep neural networks can be trained in a way that minimises energy consumption and training data requirements. These energy and data-efficient training algorithms are applied to financial modelling, demonstrating how the computational cost of deep learning in finance can be reduced. The financial sector has long been associated with negative environmental, social, and governance (ESG) impacts, including being a major contributor to global carbon emissions. Despite the attempts by some to prioritise *sustainable finance*, the recent expansion of financial technology—incorporating new, expensive methods such as *deep learning* (DL)—has only worsened the energy consumption attributed to this industry, accelerating its carbon emissions. To address these negative impacts, this project develops energy-efficient DL training algorithms for financial models. This research explores Green AI—a research domain aiming to mitigate the energy budget of DL algorithms—and applies these methods for the first time to the models and algorithms used in finance. To exemplify the benefits of these methods, a performant financial volatility model is developed that not only produces accurate results but prioritises generating this performance in an efficient manner, minimising the energy and data resources required during training. This research aims to demonstrate how the principles of Green AI are applicable within the financial sector, furthering the scope of sustainable finance by improving the sustainability of deep learning for finance and, hence, minimising the ESG impacts of the financial sector.

**Outline of research:** 

- <ins> Chapter 3: *Methodology*</ins>. This research commences by implementing a baseline model, dataset, and training algorithm characteristic of those used for DL in finance. A particular focus will be given to the domain of financial volatility modelling, as this is a major application of deep learning in finance, and the *long short-term memory* networks typically exploited for such tasks. This analysis acts as an exemplar of the computational cost of typical deep learning algorithms used in finance.

- <ins> Chapter 4: *Energy-Efficient Training Algorithms*</ins>. Alternative training algorithms are then implemented that prioritise reducing the energy consumed by DL whilst maintaining an accurately performing model. Specifically, progressive training, and mixed-precision will be explored, proving the feasibility of efficient training algorithms within the chosen domain.

- <ins> Chapter 5: *Data-Efficient Training Algorithms*</ins>. Training algorithms that prioritise data efficiency are then implemented, further lowering resource requirements and mitigating the computational costs of data storage and processing at data centres.
       
- <ins> Chapter 6: *Results \& Discussion*</ins>. An analysis is made between the baseline and extended models, comparing their performance and efficiency, and discussing the overall success of the application of Green AI to finance.
